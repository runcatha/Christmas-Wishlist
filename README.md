# All I Want for Christmas

## Overview

All I Want for Christmas: Wouldn't it be nice if you could get your friends and family exactly what they want for Christmas? Also, isn't it the worst that throughout the year you think of things that would be nice to recieve as gifts, but when someone askes you what you want you draw a blank? Have no fear because All I Want for Christmas is here to solve these problems and more! Create a profile and add items that you want as they come to mind. When the holidays roll around go to your friends/families member's profiles to pick out exactly what they want.

## MVP

> The All I Want for Christmas MVP is to have an app that utilizes authentication to have a user create an account. The user is then able to go to their wishlist and utilize full CRUD to add, view, edit, and delete items. Users are also able to view other user's wishlists to see what friends and family want. Specifics include:
> 
-a RESTful JSON API.
- Ruby on Rails server
- database with 3 tables and 2 associations (1:1 and m:m)
- uses Rails to define models to interact with the database
- Full CRUD (index, show, create, update, delete) between non-User tables
- working, interactive React app
- 9 separate, rendered components
- utilizes functional or class React components 
- utilizes state and props in components
- use only React for DOM Manipulation
- consume and render data from your Ruby on Rails API into components
- use React Router
- styled with CSS, Flexbox, and Grid to match wireframes
- front-end deployed via Netlify 
- back-end deployed via Heroku

<br>

### Goals

-  Have the back-end set up by Oct 5th
-  Code 4 to 5 components and screens for the React app (break with CSS) by Oct 6th
-  Code remaining components and screens for the React app (break with CSS) by Oct 7th
-  Complete CSS on 4 to 5 screens by Oct 8th
-  Complete CSS on remaining screens by Oct 9th
